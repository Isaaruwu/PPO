# PPO
Projet Personnel d'Orientation (PPO) is a project I made when I was 15 years old (2017). The goal of this assignment was to explore futur careers and I chose web development. My PPO is kinda like a portfolio of my coding projects and since I haven't written a single line of code at that point, the website is basically empty lol. At the time I knew practicly nothing to markup languages and coding in general and PPO introduced me to the world of web development and coding. 
 
## State of files
I sadly could not restore the final version of the website so there is a lot fix. The HTML file is not complete and there is some issues with links. There's also a lot of work to do with the CSS file too.
